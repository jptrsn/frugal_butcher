# Frugal Butcher
__tl;dr__ _A meet shortcut Chrome browser extension written in vanilla javascript. Allows you to configure custom keyboard shortcuts to work with Google Meet._

Have you ever bookmarked a tab while in a Google Meet, because you accidentally hit the keyboard command to toggle your microphone but you weren't on the right tab? Do you find yourself clicking several times just to join the next meeting on your calendar? Don't you wish there was a small, simple, and easy-to-use solution to these (made-up) problems? Well wish no more!

This extension will add the ability to perform some typical actions in Google Meet with the click of a keyboard command! Join your next scheduled meeting, automatically bring your Meet tab to the foreground, mute your audio or video without needing to find the right button, or even find the tab!

Get started by clicking on the extension icon, then click the button to set up the available shortcuts. You do not need to use all of them - simply configure the ones you would like to use. The "global" setting will apply the shortcut across your entire device, rather than the single Chrome profile on which it is installed.

## Shortcuts that always work:
- Auto-join the next meet in your calendar: automatically open a meet tab, and join the next meet scheduled on your Google Calendar (if available)
- Start an instant meet: automatically open a meet tab and create a new "instant" meet

## Shortcuts that work when you are in a Meet.
- Activate the meet tab: bring the current Meet tab to the foreground (does nothing if no meet tab discovered). Recommend Alt-Shift-A as a global setting.
- Mute the audio: toggle the microphone mute. Recommend Alt-Shift-M as a global setting.
- Mute the video: toggle the video mute. Recommend Alt-Shift-V as a global setting.

This extension can be used with multiple profiles in the same environment. However, any shortcuts that are configured to be global must be unique, and should not conflict with system shortcuts (those will take priority).

Recommended key commands are a combination of Alt, Shift, and a letter/number.
## Installation
Visit the Chrome Web Store listing and install for your Chrome profile

## Configuration
You can set up the shortcuts by clicking on the extension icon and clicking the button, or by navigating your browser to [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).
